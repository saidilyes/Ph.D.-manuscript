	volume = {95},
	issn = {0022-4790},
	doi = {10.1002/jso.20641},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Partial hepatectomy (PH) and liver transplantation (LT) compete as first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A prospectively collected database was retrospectively reviewed to establish when PH can compete with LT.
METHODS: Between 1991 and 2002, PH was performed in 131 cases of HCC (Child-Pugh A-B, technically resectable tumor without metastases). To ascertain patient survival after PH, we compared this series with a group of 40 HCC patients (G1-G2 HCC with no gross vascular invasion or metastasis) enlisted for liver transplantation during the same period.
RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year intention-to-treat survival rates were 75\%, 52\%, and 31\% for resection and 89\%, 71\%, and 63\% for transplantation. Two tumor-related variables (gross vascular invasion and histological grade) and three liver function parameters (Child-Pugh score, bilirubin, Okuda stage) proved to be independent predictors of survival after resection, whereas nodule size and number, and Milan criteria did not. The 5-year survival of the best candidates for resection (favorable tumor biology with very well preserved liver function, n = 52) was 58\%. On a descriptive basis alone, this result did not differ significantly from the outcome in LT patients. PH patients with a poorly differentiated tumor and/or gross vascular invasion (n = 28) had the worst outcome, irrespective of their liver function parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: For technically resectable tumors without aggressive features (G3 or macroscopic vascular invasion), PH can only compete with LT, in terms of long-term survival, when patients with a well-preserved liver function are selected.},

The secretion parameters were measured during a 1-h basal period and a 2-h stimulation period. The gastric juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube. Stimulation was effected by 1 mug/kg/h pentagastrin via drip infusion. The Friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation, and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the Wilcoxon test (pair-differences rank). The results show that Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume. As compared with placebo, it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone. Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid, while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion. None of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid, although both Sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values. During the basal secretion period, all three test preparations had an inhibiting action on acid concentration, but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period. The pH value was savely increased only by Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam, and this even only during the basal period. The results are discussed.},

	abstract = {Much of the delays on road networks are caused by incidents. This is partially caused by blockage or closure of lanes, but also by the change of driving behaviour in the remaining lanes. This contribution analyses traffic flow conditions near an incident both microscopically and macroscopically. A theory is proposed to describe drivers’ behaviour, which is tested using traffic data of individual vehicles, collected using a helicopter. A bimodal headway distribution is observed, centred around two mean values, 2 seconds and 4 seconds. To understand the underlying mechanisms a car-following model is fitted to the drivers’ behaviour. The model parameters show that the reaction time is much higher than usual. Using this model-based analysis, we conclude that the incident distracts the drivers and less attention is paid to the driving process. The consequence is that the queue discharge rate for the unblocked lanes is 30\% lower than the usual queue discharge rate per lane.},

	abstract = {"For the past hundred years, innovation within the automotive sector has created safer, cleaner, and more affordable vehicles, but progress has been incremental. The industry now appears close to substantial change, engendered by autonomous, or 'self-driving, ' vehicle technologies. This technology offers the possibility of significant benefits to social welfare--saving lives; reducing crashes, congestion, fuel consumption, and pollution; increasing mobility for the disabled; and ultimately improving land use. This report is intended as a guide for state and federal policymakers on the many issues that this technology raises. After surveying the advantages and disadvantages of the technology, RAND researchers determined that the benefits of the technology likely outweigh the disadvantages. However, many of the benefits will accrue to parties other than the technology's purchasers. These positive externalities may justify some form of subsidy. The report also explores policy issues, communications, regulation and standards, and liability issues raised by the technology; and concludes with some tentative guidance for policymakers, guided largely by the principle that the technology should be allowed and perhaps encouraged when it is superior to an average human driver"--Publisher's description.},

The technical aspects of using the chamber array, including chamber calibration, selection of measurement parameters, and use of the reference chamber, have been fully investigated. The measurement results from the chamber array were also confirmed by those from the single chamber and radiographic film measurements. The results reported here showed that proper operation of the chamber array is essential to measure dose accurately for the EDW fields; the chamber detector array can be used more efficiently than a single chamber without compromising the dose measurement accuracy.},

The RIA method demonstrated seropositivity in 60\% of acute and 56\% of convalescent specimens (P less than .001). Eighty-four percent of coded specimens initially positive for HBsAg by RIA were found to have subtype antigenic determinants d or y; 92\% of the HBsAg-negative controls were negative for subtype antigens, confirming the specificity of the RIA test.

This article reviews prior research on AVs and society, and articulates future needs. Research to assess future societal change induced by AVs has grown dramatically in recent years. The critical challenge in assessing the societal implications of AVs is forecasting how consumers and businesses will use them. Researchers are predicting the future use of AVs by consumers through stated preference surveys, finding analogs in current behaviors, utility optimization models, and/or staging empirical “AV-equivalent” experiments. While progress is being made, it is important to recognize that potential behavioral change induced by AVs is massive in scope and that forecasts are difficult to validate. For example, AVs could result in many consumers abandoning private vehicles for ride-share services, vastly increased travel by minors, the elderly and other groups unable to drive, and/or increased recreation and commute miles driven due to increased utility of in-vehicle time. We argue that significantly increased efforts are needed from the AVs and society research community to ensure 1) the important behavioral changes are analyzed and 2) models are explicitly evaluated to characterize and reduce uncertainty.},

The first self-sufficient and truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's Eureka Prometheus Project in 1987. Since then, numerous major companies and research organizations have developed working autonomous vehicles including Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, Continental Automotive Systems, Autoliv Inc., Bosch, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, Volvo, Vislab from University of Parma, Oxford University and Google. In July 2013, Vislab demonstrated BRAiVE, a vehicle that moved autonomously on a mixed traffic route open to public traffic.Some UNECE members and EU members and the UK have some rules and regulations related to automated and fully automated cars: In Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for driverless cars, and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed testing robotic cars in traffic.
In 2019 in Japan, related legislation for Level 3 was completed by amending two laws, and they came into effect in April 2020.
In 2021 in Germany, related legislation for Level 4 was completed.On 1 April 2023 in Japan, the amended "Road Traffic Act" which allows Level 4 was enforced.},

To achieve safe and reliable intelligent transportation systems, accurate positioning technologies need to be built to factor in the different types of uncertainties such as pedestrian behavior, random objects, and types of roads and their settings. In this work, we look into the other domains and technologies required to build an autonomous vehicle and conduct a relevant literature analysis. In this work, we look into the current state of research and development in environment detection, pedestrian detection, path planning, motion control, and vehicle cybersecurity for autonomous vehicles. We aim to study the different proposed technologies and compare their approaches. For a car to become fully autonomous, these technologies need to be accurate enough to gain public trust and show immense accuracy in their approach to solving these problems. Public trust and perception of auto vehicles are also explored in this paper. By discussing the opportunities as well as the obstacles of autonomous driving technology, we aim to shed light on future possibilities.},

The physical testing on public roads is unsafe, costly, and not always reproducible. This is where testing in simulation helps fill the gap. However, the problem with simulation testing is that it is only as good as the simulator used for testing and how representative the simulated scenarios are of the real environment. In this paper, we identify key requirements that a good simulator must have. Further, we provide a comparison of commonly used simulators. Our analysis shows that CARLA and LGSVL simulators are the current state-of-the-art simulators for end to end testing of self-driving cars for the reasons mentioned in this paper. Finally, we present current challenges that simulation testing continues to face as we march towards building fully autonomous cars.},

abstract = {In the near future, our streets will be populated by myriads of autonomous self-driving vehicles to serve our diverse mobility needs. This will raise the need to coordinate their movements in order to properly handle both access to shared resources (e.g., intersections and parking slots) and the execution of mobility tasks (e.g., platooning and ramp merging). The aim of this article is to provide a global view of the coordination issues and the related solutions in the field of autonomous vehicles. To this end, we firstly introduce the general problems associated with coordination of autonomous vehicles by identifying and framing the key classes of coordination problems. Then, we overview the different approaches that can be adopted to deal with such problems by classifying them in terms of the degree of autonomy in decision making that is left to autonomous vehicles during the coordination process. Finally, we overview some further research challenges to address before autonomous coordinated vehicles can safely hit our streets.},

abstract = {We survey research on self-driving cars published in the literature focusing on autonomous cars developed since the DARPA challenges, which are equipped with an autonomy system that can be categorized as SAE level 3 or higher. The architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars is typically organized into the perception system and the decision-making system. The perception system is generally divided into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as self-driving-car localization, static obstacles mapping, moving obstacles detection and tracking, road mapping, traffic signalization detection and recognition, among others. The decision-making system is commonly partitioned as well into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as route planning, path planning, behavior selection, motion planning, and control. In this survey, we present the typical architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars. We also review research on relevant methods for perception and decision making. Furthermore, we present a detailed description of the architecture of the autonomy system of the self-driving car developed at the Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), named Intelligent Autonomous Robotics Automobile (IARA). Finally, we list prominent self-driving car research platforms developed by academia and technology companies, and reported in the media.}

abstract = {This volume, edited by Martin Buehler, Karl Iagnemma and Sanjiv Singh, presents a unique and comprehensive collection of the scientific results obtained by finalist teams that participated in the DARPA Urban Challenge in November 2007, in the mock city environment of the George Air Force base in Victorville, California. This book is the companion of a previous volume by the same editors which was devoted to the Grand Challenge, which took place in the Nevada desert during October 2005, and was the second in the series of autonomous vehicle races sponsored by DARPA. The Urban Challenge demonstrated how cutting-edge perception, control, and motion planning techniques can allow intelligent autonomous vehicles not only to travel significant distances in off-road terrain, but also to operate in urban scenarios. Beyond the value for future military applications--which motivated DARPA to sponsor the race--the expected impact in the commercial sector for automotive manufacturers is equally, if not more, important: autonomous sensing and control constitute key technologies for vehicles of the future, and might help save thousands of lives that are now lost in traffic accidents. As with the previous STAR volume, the original papers collected in this book were initially published in special issues of the Journal of Field Robotics. Our series is proud to collect them in an archival publication as a special STAR volume!}

abstract = {Limitations both for the further development as well as for the actual technical application of autonomous robots arise from the lack of a unifying theoretical language. We propose three concepts for such a language: (1) Behaviors are represented by variables, specific constant values of which correspond to task demands; (2) Behaviors are generated as attractors of dynamical systems; (3) Neural field dynamics lift these dynamic principles to the representation of information. We show how these concepts can be used to design autonomous robots. Because behaviors are generated from attractor states of dynamical systems, design of a robot architecture addresses control-theoretic stability. Moreover, flexibility of the robot arises from bifurcations in the behavioral dynamics. Therefore techniques from the qualitative theory of dynamical systems can be used to design and tune autonomous robot architectures. We demonstrate these ideas in two implementations. In one case, visual sensory information is integrated to achieve target acquisition and obstacle avoidance in an autonomous vehicle minimizing the known problem of spurious states. In a second implementation of the same behavior, a neural dynamic field endows the system with a form of obstacle memory. A critical discussion of the approach highlights strengths and weaknesses and compares to other efforts in this direction.}
